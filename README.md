# DiscoJack
A fun blackjack bot!

Based on the previously implemented blackjack logic found in "NICKS-GAMEZ", DiscoJack was born. Instead of a simple command-line-based text-response game, DiscoJack has given blackjack (and now roulette) an interface. 

There are a few commands:
1. "!c! blackjack" summons DiscoJack for a game of blackjack.
2. "!c! roulette" summons DiscoJack for a game of roulette. 
3. "!c! scoreboard" summons a .txt file of all players' current balances. This includes EVERYONE.
4. "!c! add user <user>" adds a user to the admin whitelist. 
5. "!c! list users" lists all users in admin whitelist.
6. "!c! set money <fullplayernameand#number>" sets the current balance of the specified player, can only be done by admin on whitelist. 
  

To install and run the bot, you need to create a new application via (https://discord.com/developers/applications). Once you have a TOKEN provided to you by discord, open DiscoJack.exe, you will be prompted to enter your Discord API Token. Following that, make sure you manually input your discord username into "whitelisted.txt". You should be good to go!
